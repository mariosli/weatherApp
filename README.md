# WeatherApp

This project is a simple weather information application built using Angular. It allows users to retrieve basic weather details for a given city. The application displays the current temperature, minimum and maximum temperatures, humidity percentage, and wind speed in kilometers per hour. Users can search for a specific city using the search bar.

The weather information is fetched from the OpenWeather API, created by KirylBokiy.

## Getting Started

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
